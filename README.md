#Important Variables:

group_data_1 is the first number of the class limit, example "60-67", group_data_1 will be 60.
group_data_2 is the second number of the class limit, example "60-67", group_data_2 will be 67.

 X - is the value when you add group_data_1 and group_data_2 then divide by 2.

 frequency - the frequency of each data.

 fX - is the result when you multiple the frequency and X.

 mean - sum of fX divide by sum of frequency.

 devation - subtraction of X and mean.

 sqrd_devation - devation multiply by itself or squaring the devation.

 result - multiplying sqrd_devation and frequency.

 Variance - dividing the sum of result and sum of frequency subtract by 1.

 Standard_Devation - square root of Variance.
